## About The Project

During this assignment, Kelsie Smity [![Kelsie Smitty](https://github.com/KelsieSmitty)and I collaborated on the backend tasks, employing the Agile methodology of Test-Driven Development (TDD). As an integral component of the project, we designed and implemented 3 RESTful APIs that play a crucial role in facilitating the insurance purchasing procedure.
